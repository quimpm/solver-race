This document will explain the strategies has been used in order to make a Local Search SAT Solver. Firstly, to take an idea of how SAT should work we organised the project in different modules and classes. When we saw more or less how SAT should perfom we start implementing the SAT in a single file in order to make it faster and don't waste time importing modules. Also, it was attempted to use lazy data structures in order to have an efficient experimental cost. In the next part, it will be explained the different strategies that we studied and found so as to choose the one that will compete in the SAT race.
