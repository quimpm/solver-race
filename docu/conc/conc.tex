%TODO Coses que hem millorat despr√©s de la race, i una mica de conclusions denerals dels local search SATS
After the race we realized that a really important fact for the optimitzation of our sat were the values of max-flips and probability. So we decided to study of what value showld we assign to Max-flips, and we discovered that was the relation: 
$$num\:flips = \frac{num\:clauses}{num\:lits} * 1000$$ 
This change makes our SAT a lot faster.\\

After all, even though we dont had a good place in the race, at least we had implemented a strategy that seems that works better than the classical ones.
