\subsection{GSAT with Random Walk}
As it shows the graphic REF, this strategy outperforms the other two, this is becouse it gets the best things of both others and put it toghether. Walksat skips better local minimas but it flips randomly the literal to get the next step. And GSAT gets stuked more time in local minimas but it choses better the literal to flip. So basically, this strategy skips a lot of local minimas doing a step up and choses better the literal to flip (with the costs related of doing it).\\
Here we will show de pseudocode of the strategy:
\begin{lstlisting}
for i in max_tries:
	for j in max_flips
		if (probability p):
			pick a variable in some unsat clause
				 and flip it in the interpretation
		else:
			follow the standard GSAT scheme 
				-> Make the best possible move
\end{lstlisting}
