\framesubtitle{Why do we need to care about machine learning?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Machine learning (ML) is a category of algorithm that allows software applications to become more accurate in predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed. The basic premise of machine learning is to build algorithms that can receive input data and use statistical analysis to predict an output while updating outputs as new data becomes available.
    \item Writing software is the bottleneck, we don’t have enough good developers. Let the data do the work instead of people. Machine learning is the way to make programming scalable.
    \item Machine Learning is getting computers to program themselves. If programming is automation, then machine learning is automating the process of automation.
